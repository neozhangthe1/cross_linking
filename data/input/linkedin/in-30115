Business development and general management professional with over 13 years of work experience across IT, Aviation and Healthcare sectors.My passion has been to work with early-stage companies as I have enjoyed the entrepreneurial environment, stimulating me to contribute towards building processes and MIS for operational efficiencies. As required in any early stage company, I have openly accepted challenges and responsibilities of multiple areas, largely focusing on business development & sales processes. Multitasking in fast-paced dynamic environments only add to my energy.
