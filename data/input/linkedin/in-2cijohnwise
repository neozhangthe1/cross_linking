I currently run my own real estate company that specializes in selling REO Assets for banks, servicing companies and mortgage banks.In addition to being a California Real Estate Broker since 1993, I also spent a big part of my professional career in the mortgage business where I ran the operations and production side of 3 different companies. During that time we had to manage several REO properties and delinquent loans.
